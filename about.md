title: About us
description: Fact Benchmark is an independent non profit foundation spin off initially founded by <b>w4gl</b> - as an organisation doing research into resilient coordination protocols in distributed, unreliable environments.


---

We have been researching universal coordination protocols in a distributed environment.

One of our focuses has been on providing useful information in a crisis situtation. 

During crises (such as fires, earthquakes) there is often a lot of very useful information on social media. Unfortunately the social media streams are often made much less helpful because of the rumours and mis-information (intentional or unintentional) which gets mixed in with the useful information being shared on social media.

It is our hope that by furthering research in this area we can identify methods, partners and an aggregated consensus method that will ultimately lead to methods for a distributed network of agents and people to more reliably (and more rapidly) identify useful information from social media during a crisis.
