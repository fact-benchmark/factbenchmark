title: About us
description: Fact Benchmark is an organisation spun out of <b>W4GL</b> which is as an organisation doing research into resilient coordination protocols in distributed, unreliable environments. We are currently taking legal advice as to the best way to incorporate as an independent non profit foundation for this project.

---

W4GL has been researching universal coordination protocols in a distributed environment for some time. One of our particular focuses has been on providing useful information in a crisis situation. 

During crises (such as fires, earthquakes, floods etc) there is often a lot of very useful information on social media and in other places. Unfortunately the social media streams can become unusable because too much rumor and misinformation is mixed in with the useful and actionable intelligence.

It is our hope that by furthering research in this area we can identify and promote methods, partners and a consensus method that will allow a distributed network of agents and people to more reliably (and more rapidly) identify useful information during a crisis.

**Edward Abraham, PhD**

Edward is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.dragonfly.co.nz">Dragonfly Data Science</a>. He enjoys bringing evidence to the table, using information to make clear, principled decisions.

Edward has a PhD from the University of Cambridge, where he studied theoretical physics in the cosmology group led by Professor Stephen Hawking. He worked as an oceanographer for 10 years, researching interactions between the physical and biological environment. Since starting Dragonfly, he has focussed on statistical analysis, with a focus on applications around decision making. 

**Miles Thompson**

Miles Thompson is a technical architect with more than twenty years experience as developer and technical lead especially in finance and machine learning, including acting as the CTO and then Senior Technical Architect of the leading independent financial research provider in NYC for many years.

**Yvan Richard, PhD**

Yvan is an ecologist who specialises in using statistical computing software  to solve complex problems.

The techniques and methods he learned from work in ecology (including Bayesian analysis, and machine learning, spatial analysis, and capture-recapture models) translate perfectly into many other contexts, such as business and government. Yvanâ€™s expertise with R is particularly sought after to display information simply and beautifully.
