Needs a clearer hook
 - what is it, who is it, how does it work?
 + Add a hook herobox with big font (per km.io)
 + Three steps with icons
	* submit checkworthy claims
	* evaluate checkworthy claims
	* earn reputation points
 + Manifesto/about is too long 
 + Maybe mention that its an
   like an 'ongoing realtime kaggle competition' 
 + API should be 'try it out>'
 + API should say closed beta
 + API should open in a new tab

+ Need a league table


Name change
 +change name to 
 factbenchmark.org 
 + "realtime factcheck benchmark"
 + or ask Linc about "Fakenews Algorithmic Checking Technology Benchmark"


KISS changes to API

+ Lose Rumors and Posts for now
+ Split the checkworthy claim submit step/s from the Evaluation step
+ Make it so all the operations we do are the same as end user steps (just more reputation)
+ Benchmarks can be a separate thing, added after the fact
+ Attach 'calls' directly to  'claims'
+ Some way of indicating that a claim is related to another claim
+ 'Annotate' method on claims?
+ Separate out the claim text from the source text
+ Add a way to tell if the claim text exactly matches the source text?

For the documentation
+ Be explicit about the timedelay (24 hrs) ?

Expand the Roadmap
+ Post and rumor should be on the roadmap
+ Claims = providing evidence for why it is check worthy - in two categories - who said it or that lots of people are saying it?
