# Manifesto


## Objective

The objective of FactBenchmark is to support and encourage quality research in the field of realtime 'fake news' detection, and related fields. 

We don't aim to solve this problem ourselves, but rather to act in a supporting role, encouraging an open benchmark and the sharing of well-structured data between and amongst researchers in the field. 

## Guiding Princples

Given the objective the following guiding principles are <b>proposed</b>

* All data submitted to the benchmark will be made freely available to all interested researchers, free of charge forever, after a reasonable embargo period.
* Wherever possible, data must be clearly sourced and retain its sourcing during processing. 
* Data is never deleted, though sometimes marked hidden. Hidden data remains in the archive.
* FactBenchmark as an organization is committed to to acting as a trusted third party.
* FactBenchmark as an organization is commited to acting in a transparent way, so that third parties can not only trust, but verify our objectivity and lack of an agenda.
* In order to remain objective and uninvolved in the benchmark, FactBenchmark will not accept financial or other consideration that may hamper its ability to remain objective in regards to the benchmark. 
* If financial suppport becomes available, FactBenchmark is committed to revenue sharing with its member organizations in a way that reasonably and transparently rewards the organizations that have contributed value to the solution.
* FactBenchmark will not, itself, add data or make value judgements as to truthiness or relevancy excepting that when it does it will clearly marking data as such, and in such cases be treated according to the same 'rules' and business logic as other agents in the benchmark. 
* If judgement calls are required FactBenchmark will aim to consult with the founding members of FactBenchmark and make decisions that support the overall objective of the project, as outlined above.
* We are committed to releasing the code for this project as open source. 
* We are committed to open data as a concept and in making all data for this benchmark available for research.
