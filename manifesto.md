# Manifesto


## Objective

The objective of the Fact Benchmark is to support and encourage quality research into the rapid detection and discernment of rumours and falsity (fake news) from well supported breaking news.

## Guiding Princples
Given the objective the following guiding principles are agreed

* All data in the benchmark (or submitted to it) will eventually* be made freely available to all interested researchers, free of charge.
* All data must be clearly sourced (and retain its sourcing)
* Data is never deleted, though sometimes marked hidden. Hidden data remains in the archive.
* It is clear when data is human or machine generated.
* Fact Benchmark itself is committed to to acting as a trusted third party and not itself get into the business of fake news evaluation. In order to remain objective and uninvolved in the benchmark, Fact Benchmark will not accept financial or other consideration that may hamper its ability to remain objective in regards to the benchmark. 
* Wherever possible Fact Benchmark will not, itself, add data or make value judgements as to truthiness or relevancy of rumors.
* When judgement calls are required Fact Benchmark will aim to consult with the founding members of the Fact Benchmark group and make decisions that support the overall objective of the project, as outlined above.
* Data insertions or modifications made by Fact Benchmark will themselves be clearly marked as coming from Fact Benchmark.
* We are committed to releasing the code for this project as open source. (We will determine an appropriate licence in consultation with our members.)
* We are committed to open data as a concept and in making all data for this benchmark available for research.
