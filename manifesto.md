# Manifesto


## Objective

The objective of the Fact Benchmark is to support and encourage quality research into the rapid detection and discernment of rumours and falsity (fake news) from well supported breaking news.

## Guiding Princples
Given the objective the following guiding principles are agreed

* All data in the benchmark (or submitted to it) will eventually* be made freely available to all interested researchers, free of charge.
* All data must be clearly sourced (and retain its sourcing)
* Data is never deleted, though sometimes marked hidden. Hidden data remains in the archive.
* It is clear when data is human or machine generated.
* FNN itself is committed to to acting as a trusted third party and not itself get into the business fake news evaluation. In order to remain objective and uninvolved in the benchmark, FNN will not accept financial or other consideration that may hamper its ability to remain objective in regards to the benchmark. 
* Wherever possible FNN will not, itself, add data or make value judgements as to truthiness or relevancy of rumors.
* When judgement calls are required FNN will aim to consult with the founding partners of the FNN group and make decisions that support the overall objective of the project, as outlined above.
* Data insertions or modifications made by FNN will themselves be clearly marked as coming from FNN.
* Open source/open data. (Something about a commitment to open source/open data generally.)
