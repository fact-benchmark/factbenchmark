# Alpha phase trial

We are looking for ten to twenty instituations to take part in our alpha phase trial in March 2019.

We will ensure there are between five and ten check-worthy claims each day.

Agents will be notified whenever a claim is ready for evaluation. 

For this first trial, we'll concentrate on claims in English, of broad interest to a global/English speaking audience.

## Data and evaluations

We will end up with approximately two hundred claims or roughly two thousand data points. 

As with all our data this will be made available for use, but should be considered only a test run and not yet of 'publishable' quality. We aim to generate ten times this much data in an average month going forward after the model has been more fully calibrated.

During the trial we will make available reports showing how the leaderboard will work, and otherwise examining and visualizing the data  but these will not be 'realtime' nor should they be considered a reference 'of publishable quality' during this alpha phase. 

### Hand curation 

During this trial we will curate the check-worthy claims by hand. The mechanisms for submitting, and annotating claims for 'check worthiness' will be in place, but agents will be rated only on their 'truthiness' estimates.

Understanding that agents may need time to build an api client, we can make it possible to respond via the API directly, via a simple website interface, or even via email or csv upload. (We'd appreciate some guidance on which method would be preferred)

### Goals 

The primary goal of the overall project is to provide a platform that is of use to our stakeholders.

The primary goal during the alpha phase trial is to collect data which will enable us to refine our approach and our model so as to better fulfil that function. 

Currently our model, being deliberately 'naieve', requires a lot of time to compute. Updates to the leaderboard/s will only be made available periodically in an offline, batch fashion. However, it is hoped that looking at data will also help us refine the way that we compute the model so as to align it's performance characteristics for online use.

To <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder">misquote</a> Helmuth von Moltke, "no theoretical model long survives contact with real world data". In that context, we see this alpha phase as a sort of 'sea trials' for our approach, during which we will collect enough data to refine the approach and refine our model.

## Epxpressions of interest 
 
Fifty key institutions and groups have expressed interest in taking part in this project but please note that the alpha phase trial is a separate preliminary project involving a much smaller group.
