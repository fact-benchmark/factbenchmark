An ongoing, real time, kaggle-like competition.

We aim to provide an independent benchmark to 
support and encourage the development of
technologies and procedures for rapid 
detection and discernment of rumour from fact.

Submit checkworthy claims

Be the first to detect falsifiable check-worthy 
claims or rumors of interest to the public. 

Evaluate checkworthy claims

Estimate the validity of claims or rumours
using any data, technology or process you
choose. 

Earn reputation points

Earn reputation by making correct, early,
estimates of future consensus.

Our leaderboard requires comparison of 
early estimates to after-the fact consensus
weighted by high reputation for organisations
performing actual journalism. More details here.
